/**
 * Describes the surface of a generic persistence driver, which is capable of accepting arbitrary structured and typed
 * business data (also called "data models"), and managing them with regard to persistent storage, which includes
 * storing them when asked, and recalling them when subsequently asked to do so.
 *
 * <p>Persistence driver implementations do not always guarantee <i>durability</i> of data. For example,
 * {@link CacheDriver} implementations are also {@link PersistenceDriver}s, and that entire class of implementations
 * does not guarantee data will be there when you ask for it <i>at all</i> (relying on cache state is generally
 * considered to be a very bad practice).</p>
 *
 * <p>Other implementation trees exist (notably, {@link DatabaseDriver}) which go the other way, and are expected to
 * guarantee durability of data across restarts, distributed systems and networks, and failure cases, as applicable.
 * Database driver implementations also support richer data storage features like querying and indexing.</p>
 *
 * @see CacheDriver <pre>`CacheDriver`</pre> for persistence drivers with volatile durability guarantees
 * @see DatabaseDriver <pre>`DatabaseDriver`</pre> for drivers with rich features and/or strong durability guarantees.
 * @param <Key> Key record type (must be annotated with model role {@code OBJECT_KEY}).
 * @param <Model> Message/model type which this persistence driver is specialized for.
 * @param <Intermediate> Intermediate record format used by the underlying driver implementation during serialization.
