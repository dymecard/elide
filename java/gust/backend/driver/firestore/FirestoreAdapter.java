/**
 * Defines a built-in database adapter for interacting with Google Cloud Firestore, using business-data models defined
 * through Protobuf annotated with framework-provided metadata.
 *
 * <p>This adapter makes use of a specialized {@link DatabaseDriver} ({@link FirestoreDriver}), and supports a custom
 * configuration class ({@link FirestoreTransportConfig}) which is loaded from application config during service channel
 * initialization. Connections are pooled and cached against a caching executor by the active transport manager.</p>
 *
 * <p>Instantiation is disallowed to facilitate restriction of the active {@link ModelCodec} to Firestore's own model
 * codec, which uses {@link gust.backend.model.ObjectModelCodec} to produce generic collapsed messages during
 * serialization, and to translate from proto-maps during deserialization. Optionally, a compliant instance of
 * {@link CacheDriver} may be provided at construction time, which enables caching against that driver for calls that
 * are eligible (according, again, to settings from {@link FirestoreTransportConfig}).</p>
 *
 * @param <Model> Model type which this adapter adapts to Firestore.
 * @see FirestoreDriver Driver for speaking to Firestore.
 * @see FirestoreTransportConfig Transport configuration for Firestore.
