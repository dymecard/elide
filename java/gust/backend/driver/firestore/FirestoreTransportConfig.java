/**
 * Specifies configuration property bindings for a managed transport channel interacting with Cloud Firestore. Also in
 * charge of supplying a sensible set of defaults, if no config properties are specified.
 *
 * <p>Configurable aspects of the framework's connection to Firestore include keepalive timings, retries, connection
 * pooling, connection refreshing, and more. All of these may be customized via a number of code paths:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Environment:</b> By default, Micronaut will automatically merge config with environment vars.</li>
 *   <li><b>Config:</b> You can configure things under the <pre>transport.google.firestore</pre> prefix.</li>
 *   <li><b>Bean events:</b> You can watch for a bean event creating this object, and use the methods on it to change
 *       configured values before they are used.</li>
 * </ul></p>
