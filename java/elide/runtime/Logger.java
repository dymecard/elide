 * Describes a generic, cross-platform interface for a named logger; loggers can be initialized from classes, in which
 * case the class' full package path is used as the name.

 * Logging is implemented on each platform according to the typical semantics of that platform. On the JVM, logging is
 * backed by SLF4J, which then typically uses a runtime implementation like Logback. In frontend circumstances, the
 * browser console is used as the logging backend.
